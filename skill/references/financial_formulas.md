# Financial Formulas & Calculations

## Core Financial Statements

### Profit & Loss (Income Statement)
```
Revenue (Sales)
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit

Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses
= Operating Income (EBIT)

Operating Income
- Interest & Taxes
= Net Income
```

### Balance Sheet
```
ASSETS = LIABILITIES + EQUITY

Assets:
- Current Assets (cash, AR, inventory)
- Fixed Assets (equipment, property)

Liabilities:
- Current Liabilities (AP, short-term debt)
- Long-term Liabilities (loans, bonds)

Equity:
- Owner's Equity
- Retained Earnings
```

### Cash Flow Statement
```
Operating Activities
+ Investing Activities
+ Financing Activities
= Net Change in Cash
```

## Key Financial Ratios

### Liquidity Ratios
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
```

### Profitability Ratios
```
Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) × 100
Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) × 100
Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Income / Total Assets
Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholder Equity
```

### Efficiency Ratios
```
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × 365
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
```

### Leverage Ratios
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Total Equity
Debt-to-Assets = Total Debt / Total Assets
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
```

## Working Capital Calculations

```
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
Net Working Capital Ratio = Working Capital / Total Assets
```

## Cash Flow Metrics

```
Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation - Change in Working Capital
Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
Burn Rate = (Starting Cash - Ending Cash) / Number of Months
Runway = Current Cash / Monthly Burn Rate
```

## Revenue Recognition

### SaaS Metrics
```
MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) = Sum of all monthly subscription revenue
ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) = MRR × 12
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) = Total Revenue / Number of Users
Churn Rate = (Customers Lost / Total Customers at Start) × 100
```

### E-commerce
```
Average Order Value (AOV) = Total Revenue / Number of Orders
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) = (Average Order Value × Purchase Frequency) × Customer Lifespan
```

## Payroll Calculations

```
Gross Wages = Hours Worked × Hourly Rate (or Salary)
FICA Taxes = Gross Wages × 7.65% (Social Security 6.2% + Medicare 1.45%)
Net Pay = Gross Wages - (Federal Tax + State Tax + FICA + Other Deductions)

Employer Payroll Taxes:
- FICA Match: 7.65%
- Federal Unemployment (FUTA): 0.6% on first $7,000
- State Unemployment (SUTA): Varies by state
```

## Depreciation Methods

### Straight-Line
```
Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
```

### Declining Balance
```
Annual Depreciation = Book Value × Depreciation Rate
```

## Break-Even Analysis

```
Break-Even Point (units) = Fixed Costs / (Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)
Break-Even Point (dollars) = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio
Contribution Margin = Revenue - Variable Costs
Contribution Margin Ratio = Contribution Margin / Revenue
```

## Account Reconciliation

```
Bank Balance (per statement)
+ Deposits in Transit
- Outstanding Checks
= Adjusted Bank Balance

Book Balance (per ledger)
+ Interest Earned
- Bank Fees
= Adjusted Book Balance

Adjusted Bank Balance should equal Adjusted Book Balance
```
