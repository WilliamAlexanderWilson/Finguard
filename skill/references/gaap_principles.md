# GAAP Principles & Accounting Standards

## Core GAAP Principles

### 1. Economic Entity Assumption
Business transactions are separate from the owner's personal transactions. Keep personal and business finances completely separate.

### 2. Monetary Unit Assumption
All transactions are recorded in a stable currency (e.g., USD). Ignore inflation unless material.

### 3. Time Period Assumption
Business activities can be divided into specific time periods (monthly, quarterly, annually) for reporting purposes.

### 4. Cost Principle
Assets are recorded at their original purchase price, not current market value.

### 5. Full Disclosure Principle
All relevant financial information must be disclosed in financial statements or accompanying notes.

### 6. Going Concern Principle
Assume the business will continue operating indefinitely unless there's evidence to the contrary.

### 7. Matching Principle
Expenses should be matched to the revenues they help generate in the same accounting period.

### 8. Revenue Recognition Principle
Revenue is recognized when earned, not necessarily when cash is received.

### 9. Materiality Principle
Only record transactions that would influence the decision-making of users of financial statements.

### 10. Conservatism Principle
When in doubt, choose the accounting method that least overstates assets or income.

## Accrual vs. Cash Basis

### Cash Basis
- Revenue recorded when cash received
- Expenses recorded when cash paid
- Simpler, used by very small businesses
- Not GAAP compliant

### Accrual Basis
- Revenue recorded when earned
- Expenses recorded when incurred
- GAAP compliant
- Required for businesses with inventory
- More accurate picture of financial health

## Double-Entry Bookkeeping

Every transaction affects at least two accounts:

```
Debits = Credits (always)

Asset Accounts: Debit increases, Credit decreases
Liability Accounts: Credit increases, Debit decreases
Equity Accounts: Credit increases, Debit decreases
Revenue Accounts: Credit increases, Debit decreases
Expense Accounts: Debit increases, Credit decreases
```

### Common Journal Entry Patterns

**Sale on Credit:**
```
DR Accounts Receivable
  CR Sales Revenue
```

**Pay Expense with Cash:**
```
DR Expense Account
  CR Cash
```

**Receive Payment on Invoice:**
```
DR Cash
  CR Accounts Receivable
```

**Purchase on Credit:**
```
DR Inventory/Expense
  CR Accounts Payable
```

**Payroll:**
```
DR Wages Expense
DR Payroll Tax Expense
  CR Cash
  CR Payroll Tax Payable
```

## Revenue Recognition Rules

### Point of Sale
Most retail and service businesses recognize revenue when:
- Service is rendered or product is delivered
- Price is fixed or determinable
- Collection is reasonably assured

### Percentage of Completion
For long-term contracts:
- Recognize revenue based on project completion percentage
- Common in construction, consulting

### Subscription/SaaS
- Recognize revenue ratably over subscription period
- Upfront payments create "Deferred Revenue" (liability)
- Revenue recognized monthly as service is provided

### Multiple-Element Arrangements
When a sale includes multiple deliverables, allocate revenue to each element based on fair value.

## Expense Recognition

### Period Costs
Expensed immediately when incurred:
- Office supplies
- Utilities
- Rent
- Professional fees

### Capitalized Costs
Recorded as assets, then depreciated/amortized:
- Equipment over $2,500 (typical threshold)
- Buildings
- Intangible assets (patents, trademarks)

### Inventory/COGS
- Manufacturing costs capitalized as inventory
- Expensed as COGS when sold

## Financial Statement Requirements

### Balance Sheet
Must show:
- Assets (current and non-current)
- Liabilities (current and long-term)
- Equity
- As of a specific date

### Income Statement
Must show:
- Revenue
- Expenses (by category)
- Net income
- For a period of time

### Cash Flow Statement
Must categorize cash flows:
- Operating activities
- Investing activities

### Statement of Changes in Equity
Shows changes in:
- Owner contributions
- Distributions

## Internal Controls

### Segregation of Duties
- Person recording transactions ≠ person handling cash
- Person approving payments ≠ person making payments
- Regular reconciliations by independent party

### Documentation
- Retain all source documents (invoices, receipts, contracts)
